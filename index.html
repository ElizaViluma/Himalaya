        <p>
            The Himalayas is a mountain range found in Southeast Asia.  
            North of the Himalayas is the Tibetan Plateau and south is the Indo-Gangetic Plain.  The Himalayas form the northern border of the Indian subcontinent.
            About 2,500 km in length, the east-west mountain range spans five countries: India, Nepal, Bhutan, China (Tibet), and Pakistan.
            Nine of the ten highest peaks on Earth, including the highest, Mount Everest are found in the Himalayas.
